            <p>As a partner of the German Archaeological Institute, the CoDArchLab
                cooperates with the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/" target=
                        "_blank">Perseus Digital Library</a> at Tufts University to combine the
                digital collections of classical studies of both institutions. Thus one of
                the most comprehensive and free online collections of Greek and Roman
                antiquity will be available for public and scientific use. The basis of the
                Hellespont project is the combination of text and object data using the
                metadata format CIDOC CRM. The CRM mapping of the Arachne database is part of
                other projects of the CoDArchLab carried out at the moment. The use of CIDOC CRM
                to map ancient text content in order to build a bridge to other types of
                sources is a methodological innovation. The material world in Thucydides'
                <i>Pentecontaetia</i> (Thuc. 1,89 to 1,118) is the chosen starting point
                for the integration of both data sets; other parts of the text will follow
                at a later stage.</p>
            <p><a href="/con10t/img/hellespont/Thuc1.png"><img width="275" src=

            <p>One task of the project consists in manually identifying entities
                representing categories in the archaeological and textual evidence (e.g.
                built spaces, topography, individual persons, populations) within the whole
                text of Thucydides’ <i>Pentecontaetia</i>. These entities will be annotated
                according to the TEI guidelines, so as to enrich the text simultaneously
                with historical background information.</p>
            <p>Event annotation is also performed simultaneously, taking as a basis the
                mainly discussed historical events of the text in modern research
                literature. At this level of analysis, the word strings annotated with TEI
                markup represent historical events according to the description of the
                ancient author, which finally ended in the political and military conflict
                between Athens and Sparta (Peloponnesian War). In the following part of the
                project, the main content of Thucydides' text will be mapped using the
                event-based CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model with reference to these word
                strings.</p>
            <p>At the same time, supported by a <a href=
                                                           "http://chs.harvard.edu/wa/pageR?tn=Fellowships&amp;bdc=12&amp;mn=0"
                                                   target="_blank">CHS/DAI joint fellowship</a>, the narrative and
                discursive
                structure of the text, as well as all its relevant linguistic features, are
                also being annotated. One of the goals of the linguistic annotation is to
                provide a more solid background for the aforementioned task of event
                identification. The linguistic annotation of Thucydides' Histories is
                performed according to the guidelines of the <a href=
                                                                        "http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/"

                    Greek Dependency Treebank</a>, which provide a word-by-word analysis of the
                morphological and syntactical features of the text. A further level of
                linguistic analysis, namely the so-called “tectogrammatical annotation” on
                semantic and pragmatic aspects which are necessary to understand the event
                structure of a text, will be tested following the model of the <a href=

            <p>Furthermore, to open up the broader historical context of the related
                sources, we explore the idea of a VRE combining archaeological and
                philological data with secondary research literature and in particular
                journal articles, that will be collected in an automized way. This part of
                the research is carried out in the context of a PhD project at the <a href=

                Thucydides Project at the CoDArchLab.</p>
            <p>The combination of all available sources on a historical topic by means

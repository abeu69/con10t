                The complete catalog of sculptures in the Antikensammlung der
                Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin (Antiquities Collection of the Berlin State
                Museums) contains approximately 2,600 Greek, Cypriot, Etruscan, and Roman
                sculptures in stone, as well as several large bronzes (including both
                extant objects and those now lost). The catalog is based on a full-scale
                reexamination of these objects conducted by <cite>Das Berliner Skulpturennetzwerk</cite>
                (“The Berlin Sculpture Network”) in 2009-2012. Already in 2011, the bronzes
                in the Antiquities Collection (8,277 individual objects, including those
                lost in the war) were made publicly available in the online database
                <a href="http://www.smb.museum/antikebronzenberlin/" target="_blank">Antike
                    Bronzen in Berlin</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some 2,600 objects from the Berlin Antiquities Collection have been
                newly photographed from multiple viewpoints and supplemented with
                historical photographs and documentation of restoration. Numerous
                sculptures stood before the camera lens for the very first time. In
                addition, over one hundred researchers contributed new, detailed texts.
                Special attention was devoted to investigating context, which led to many
                new discoveries through intensive archival research; this also enabled a
                thorough examination of the sculptures’ original display contexts and
                post-antique reception. The sculpture from Pergamon and Magnesia on the
                Meander underwent special scrutiny, as their excavation documentation was
                systematically inspected.

            <p>
                Within the scope of the <cite>Berliner Skulpturennetzwerk</cite>, all plaster casts were also
                documented according to Greco-Roman sculptures in Berlin (
                <a con10t-page="berlinsamml">Catalog of plaster castings according to Greco-Roman sculptures in Berlin collections</a>).
